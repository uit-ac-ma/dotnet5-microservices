Represent the whole application **CrossCutting Concerns**

## Concerns Type
*A Concern is a term that refers to a part of the system divided on the basis of the functionality.*

There are two types of concerns:

1 - The concerns representing single and specific functionality for primary requirements are known as **core concerns**.
OR
Primary functionality of the system is known as core concerns.
For example: Business logic
2 - The concerns representing functionalities for secondary requirements are referred to as **crosscutting concerns** or system-wide concerns.
OR
The **crosscutting concern** is a concern which is applicable throughout the application and it affects the entire application.
For example: logging, security and data transfer are the concerns which are needed in almost every module of an application, hence they are cross-cutting concerns.
